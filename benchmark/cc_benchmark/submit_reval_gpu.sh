# Published configuration for the ds004505 single-model benchmark:
#   64 retained PCs, 3,000-iteration cap, seed 42, M=1, K=3, float64.
# Subjects chosen as the first three of the 25-participant cohort.
# --output-dir keeps the result JSON with the job rather than in the repo's
# ./results (the runner's CWD-relative default), and the redirected stream is
# the runner's progress log, not data -- see submit_reval_cpu.sh.
#
# --schema-version v3 is REQUIRED, not cosmetic. It is what sets
# include_artifacts (runner.py:1270), and complete MIR is computed only inside
# that block. The default is "legacy", so job 53268540 produced no MIR at all
# and could not be compared against the paper's headline per-subject metric --
# the published data set is v3_paper_stage1_cluster, written under this schema.

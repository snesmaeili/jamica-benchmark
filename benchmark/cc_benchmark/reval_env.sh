# Environment for the S6 re-validation jobs.
#
# Deliberately NOT fir_env.sh. That script is sourced by ~28 other submit
# scripts, installs `-e "$REPO_ROOT[all,gpu]"` -- extras this repository does
# not define -- and provisions a venv shared with the historical runs. S6 needs
# the opposite: a self-contained environment with no editable installs, in
# which the algorithm under test is unambiguous.
#
# Why that matters here specifically: this repository vendors its own copy of
# the algorithm under amica_python/, and that copy predates PR #17 (it has no
# rank guard and no _blocked_posteriors). The published numbers came from it,
# so it is kept as the historical record and left alone. The re-validation must
# exercise the *release* instead, so the harness imports `jamica` and the two
# packages are separated by path:
#
#   jamica                     -> $AMICA_RELEASE   the release under test
#   amica_python.benchmark.*  -> $REPO            the harness
#
# Nothing is pip-installed editable, so PYTHONPATH is authoritative and no
# meta-path finder can silently redirect an import. (A shared venv's editable
# finder is exactly how /scratch/$USER/amica-python/.venv_fir ended up
# resolving amica_python to an unrelated feature-branch checkout.)
#
# Verified on compute node fc30669, job 53256186: numpy 2.4.2, scipy 1.17.0,
# mne 1.12.1, jax 0.9.1 -- matching the published stack -- with jamica resolving
# to the release checkout and the rank/chunking fixes both present.
#
# Requires $REPO to be set by the caller (the submit scripts derive it from
# SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR). Set AMICA_REVAL_GPU=1 before sourcing for a GPU job.

# `set -u` must be OFF across the module block: the Compute Canada profile
# reads SKIP_CC_CVMFS while unset (bash.sh:2), and sbatch/srun give a
# non-login shell in which the `module` function is not defined at all.
# Both facts cost a failed job apiece before they were pinned down.

# S6 re-validation, chunking half: reproduce the PUBLISHED chunking parity pair
# against the released amica.
#
# Why this exists separately from submit_reval_cpu.sh: that job drives
# runner.py, which preprocesses differently from the script that produced the
# published numbers -- 1-100 Hz plus a 60 Hz notch and no average reference,
# against this script's 1-40 Hz with average reference -- and compares two
# separate runs rather than two fits in one process. Those are different data
# and a different metric, so the published pair is not reachable that way.
# Running the original script is the only like-for-like comparison.
#
# Published values (figures/src/main_figure_stats.json -> figure2.chunking,
# from results/mne_chunking/summary.json):
#     absolute_final_ll_difference          5.91657431492365e-07
#     unmixing_frobenius_relative_error     1.448769887359409e-04
#     sensor_unmixing_frobenius_relative_error  1.6841895262134987e-04
# and for reference, published wall times: full 107.6 s, chunked 90.4 s
# (chunked was FASTER, ratio 0.84).
#
# This job asserts nothing. It writes summary.json and the comparison happens
# off-cluster, so the thing being tested does not get to judge itself.
